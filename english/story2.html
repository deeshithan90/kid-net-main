            Once upon a time, in a peaceful forest village, lived a poor but honest woodcutter. Every morning, he walked
            deep into the woods with his old axe, cutting just enough wood to earn his daily bread.

            One day, while chopping wood near a river, his axe slipped from his hands and fell into the deep water.

            The woodcutter sat down sadly.
            “My only axe… how will I work now?” he cried.

            Suddenly, the river began to shine. A forest spirit rose from the water holding a golden axe.

            “Is this your axe?” the spirit asked.

            The woodcutter shook his head immediately.
            “No, that is not mine. I am too poor to own something so grand.”

            The spirit disappeared into the water and returned holding a silver axe.

            “Is this your axe?” she asked again.

            The woodcutter replied,
            “No, that one is not mine either.”

            Finally, the spirit brought out his old, worn wooden-handled iron axe.

            The woodcutter’s face lit up.
            “Yes! That’s my axe!”

            The spirit smiled.
            “Your honesty deserves a reward.”

            She gave him all three axes — gold, silver, and iron — and vanished into the river again.

            The woodcutter went home happily. From that day on, he lived a comfortable life, always remembered for his
            honesty.

            And the villagers would say:
            “Honesty brings more riches than greed ever can.”

        <h1>The Cunning Fox and the Brave Rooster</h1>

            In a small farm village lived a brave rooster named Raku. Every morning he crowed loudly from the tallest
            fence post, waking up the whole farm.

            A hungry fox heard Raku’s powerful voice. “If I catch that rooster, I’ll never be hungry again,” he thought.

            One evening the fox sneaked into the farm and whispered,
            “Oh noble rooster, I have wonderful news! The king of animals has declared peace between all creatures. We
            will never harm each other again!”

            Raku narrowed his eyes — he knew foxes were tricky.

            “That’s great!” he said. “Let me call my friend, the farm dog, so he can hear the good news too!”

            The fox panicked. “Dog?? Oh… I just remembered something important! I must go!”

            And he ran away before the dog even arrived.

            Raku laughed. “A liar always fears the truth.”

            The animals on the farm praised Raku for his wisdom and bravery.

            Moral: Clever thinking protects you from danger.
